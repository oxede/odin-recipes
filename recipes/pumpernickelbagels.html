      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>

      <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>

      <li>Cornmeal, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header">Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, pumpernickel flour,
        cocoa powder, instant yeast, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, mix the warm water, molasses, and brown sugar until
        well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough
        forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, or until it
        becomes smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let
        it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 equal portions. Shape each
        portion into a bagel shape, ensuring there is a hole in the center.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
      <li>
        Boil a large pot of water and add the bagels. Boil for about 1-2 minutes
        per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bagels from the boiling water and place them on a baking
        sheet lined with cornmeal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the bagels are
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Let the bagels cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
