     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>4 slices of white or sourdough bread</li>
       <li>4 slices of cooked ham</li>
       <li>1 cup Gruyère cheese, grated</li>
       <li>4 large eggs</li>
       <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)</li>
       <li>Salt and pepper to taste</l>
      </ul>
     <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
       <li>Start by making the béchamel sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk constantly for about 2 minutes until it forms a smooth paste (a roux).</li>
       <li>Gradually add the milk while continuing to whisk. Cook the sauce, stirring, until it thickens and becomes smooth, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
       <li>If desired, season the béchamel sauce with nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste. Remove it from the heat and set it aside.</li>
       <li>Preheat your oven's broiler.</li>
       <li>Toast the slices of bread on one side until lightly browned, then flip them over.</li>
       <li>Place a slice of ham on each slice of bread, followed by a generous amount of grated Gruyère cheese.</li>
       <li>Place the open-faced sandwiches under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
       <li>While the sandwiches are broiling, in a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.</li>
       <li>Once the sandwiches are done, remove them from the broiler and place a fried egg on top of each one.</li>
       <li>Serve your Croque Madame hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
