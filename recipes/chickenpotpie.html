      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 package refrigerated pie crusts (2 crusts)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header">Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add onions,
        potatoes, and carrots. Cook until the vegetables are tender.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the flour, salt, pepper, and thyme until well combined.</li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the
        mixture thickens and comes to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked chicken and frozen mixed vegetables. Cook for a few more
        minutes until everything is heated through.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Line a pie dish with one of the pie crusts.</li>
      <li>Pour the chicken mixture into the pie crust.</li>
      <li>
        Place the second pie crust on top, and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a
        few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is
        golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
      </li>
      <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
